# Diwali Sales Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes Diwali sales data to extract meaningful business insights. Using Python and popular data science libraries, we perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualize key trends in customer behavior, product performance, and sales distribution.

## Dataset
The dataset contains sales records from Diwali shopping events. It includes details such as:
- Customer demographics (Gender, Age, Marital Status, State)
- Purchase details (Orders, Amount, Product Category, etc.)

## Key Analyses
- **Data Cleaning:** Removed null values and unnecessary columns, converted data types.
- **Customer Insights:** Analyzed purchase behavior based on gender, age groups, and marital status.
- **Geographical Trends:** Identified sales performance across different states.
- **Product Insights:** Analyzed top-selling product categories and order values.
- **Data Visualization:** Used Matplotlib and Seaborn to generate insightful visualizations.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy (Data manipulation)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data visualization)
